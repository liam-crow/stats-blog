The Brisbane City Council has an Open Data website, which hosts a wide variety of open source data, freely available for download. I've created a small self contained app that collates and visualises the 'Animal Permits' csv. I've created 2 basic visualisations using Rshiny and Plotly, showing the top 15 data points.

```{css, echo=FALSE}
#main {
    display: inline;
    float: left;
    width: 1200px;
}
```

<div class="container"><div class="h_iframe"><iframe  src="https://crowdatascience.shinyapps.io/where_are_the_dogs/" frameborder="0" height="700px" width="1100" position="absolute"></iframe></div></div>

The interactive components are hosted on https://www.shinyapps.io/ for free.

Next step would be to assign each suburb a latitude and longitude coordinate, and plot the resulting density of a specific breed on a map using `leaflet`.

You can access the raw data from the BCC open data website [here](https://www.data.brisbane.qld.gov.au/data/dataset/current-animal-related-permits/resource/c2823090-8a44-4c8b-9ed4-e988491b25f4){target="blank"} and the source code for this app [here](https://github.com/liam-crow/shiny-apps/tree/master/where-are-the-dogs). `animal_permits.rds` is a clean version of the data that is used by the app, while `animal_permits_july_2021.csv` is the raw data.
