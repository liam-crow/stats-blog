### Who am I?

My name is Liam, and I'm a Data scientist. I currently work in financial research, and have a keen interest in R, open source data and football (AFL).

### What will I post about?

I don't know, mainly footy related, a bit of government and council data. Whatever takes my interest, I guess.

### Where does the AFL data come from?

My main reference is afltables.com, and I use fitzRoy to import this data into R.
