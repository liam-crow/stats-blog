### Who am I?

My name is Liam, and I'm a Data scientist. I currently work in financial research, and have a keen interest in R, open source data and football (AFL).

### What will I post about?

I don't know, mainly footy related, a bit of government and council data. Whatever takes my interest, I guess.

### What theme is this?

The theme was downloaded from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
