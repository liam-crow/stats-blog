      <p>I&rsquo;ve been co-admin of a little page on Facebook that caters to a niche audience of AFL statistics nerds known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/uselessaflstats">Useless AFL Stats</a>, where Aaron and I find out stats that have no relevance to anything at all, and will never be useful to anyone, ever. And that got me thinking, why should I have all the fun finding these nuggets of gold?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a firm believer in open source programming and data, the idea that as much data should be made publicy available as possible to the largest possible audience. After all, 1000 plus brains are going to be more innovative, better at analysing trends, faster at fact checking (and creating useless AFL stats) than 2.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll be taking you on a journey from beginner to expert, to give you the tools to be the master of your own AFL data analysis. Key points will be covered in this first post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup of your coding workspace
<ul>
<li>R installation</li>
<li>Rstudio installation and setup</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basics of R</li>
<li>Downloading AFL data</li>
<li>Creating your first useless AFL stat</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions during this tutorial, you can tweet at me <a href="https://twitter.com/crow_data_sci">@crow_data_sci</a>. If you&rsquo;ve got a useless stat, feel free to tweet at us <a href="https://twitter.com/UselessStatsAFL">@UselessStatsAFL</a> or message the page.</p>
<p>Ok, let get into the stats!</p>
<h1 id="r-and-rstudio-installation">R and Rstudio Installation</h1>
<p>The program that I use to generate stats is R, a powerful tool commonly used by professional statisticians and data scientists in academia and industry, but we&rsquo;ll be using it to shitpost about AFL stats.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be downloading R from here <a href="https://cran.csiro.au/">https://cran.csiro.au/</a> and choose the version for your OS. I&rsquo;d reccommend all the default file locations and setup.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll also be downloading Rstudio, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows for easier use of the R language. Download the free version here at <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/</a>.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve downloaded both, open up your newly installed Rstudio. It should automatically find R and open up an interface. Think of R as the frame, steering wheel and engine of a car. You can get pretty far with just that, but Rstudio completes the car. God thats a terrible analogy.</p>
<p>Anyway, you should see a screen and tab named &lsquo;Console&rsquo;. This is where all the the commands get executed, lets try one out.</p>
